## üîê Professional Statement

With years of experience serving ultra-high-net-worth clients in highly regulated, compliance-driven environments, I have built a proven track record of managing sensitive personal and financial data with integrity, discretion, and precision. I'm drawn to cybersecurity because it allows me to extend that same responsibility ‚Äî not just to protect clients, but also companies, employees, and stakeholders.

My strengths in trilingual communication (Mandarin, Cantonese, English), meticulous attention to detail, and disciplined execution enable me to handle high-sensitivity information in alignment with legal and ethical standards. I‚Äôm excited to bring these qualities into cybersecurity roles that support organizational security goals, data privacy, and stakeholder trust.
